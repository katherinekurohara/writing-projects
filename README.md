## Writing Project Descriptions

### Memorandum: Sustainability Initiatives

* Context: **1st of 3** projects for **Advanced Writing at USC Marshall School of Business** (Note: I dedicated a significant percentage of my semester to the course, consistently coming out at the top of the class in which the Professor chose to use my writing pieces as an example to showcase the course projects for future semesters.)

As part of an USC Marshall advanced writing course, I identified and substantiated environmental sustainability as a major business trend in the context of the E-commerce sector. Since this class catered to writing in business context, this piece is set up to mimic an actual business scenario -- I'm writing in the role of an analyst at a major consulting firm providing a corporate client (Wanderlust + Co) with information that could impact long-range internal and external planning in the E-commerce sector in the context of green trends. My analysis is adapted to the defined target audience (CEO) and their motives, with an understanding of how the reader's business is being affected by the global eco trend.

### Corporate Social Activism

* Context: **2nd of 3** projects for **Advanced Writing at USC Marshall School of Business**

Pressures on companies and their CEOs are intensifying to demonstrate their ethicality by taking stands on social and political issues. But many executives do not feel in control, nor are they clear about the risks and the rewards. They are struggling to be perceived as good corporate citizens and to anticipate and respond to the public, investors, and their employees. Their decisions may affect a company’s value and, potentially, their return on investment.

As an independent analyst hired to conduct a report on the corporate social activism (CSA) trend, I am informing the company's (Caliroots) decision-maker on whether taking a stand on an issue as a corporate leader really matters and what benefits or detriments come with it. The target reader (Caliroots CCO) has asked me to analyze whether adopting, continuing, or enhancing this CSA practice is desirable and realistic. I adapted my analysis to their concerns, political stance, familiarity with CSA, and company context, ultimately leading to my final recommendation of a path forward for my client's CSA strategy. 


### Memorandum: Juneteenth

* Context: **3rd of 3** projects for **Advanced Writing at USC Marshall School of Business**

This is a position paper employing persuasion techniques to convince the readers: the ten members of the Board of Directors of Legacy National Bank in Springdale, Arkansas. They are politically and socially conservative. All board members are white males except one white female. The bank was incorporated in 2005. It has nine locations and assets worth $876 million. Serves primarily local customers in northwest Arkansas. 

The bank observes the standard American holidays, on which they are closed for business. With the recent White House proclamations establishing Indigenous Peoples’ Day and Juneteenth as official federal holidays, the board is reluctant to acknowledge these. While some on the board have shown mild curiosity, most resist the imposition of these holidays and are not inclined to cooperate. Some of the board dismiss these newly designated holidays as mere symptoms of political correctness and “woke” culture. They are concerned about alienating customers. The State of Arkansas has never observed either of these holidays, although a few local communities have.

My role as a branch manager who joined the bank two years ago and has earned respect, I hold a personal belief that these new holidays (specifically Juneteenth) have a legitimate and long overdue place as symbolic acknowledgment of disadvantaged, nondominant groups. I've decided write to the board to express my support for these days and explain why, making sure to have credibility and make a compelling case that both educates and advocates. I understand Legacy’s culture both as a financial institution and an expression of traditional sociopolitical beliefs in the context of a community that has tended to be right of center.
